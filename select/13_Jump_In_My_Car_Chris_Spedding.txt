Jump in my car,
I wanna take you home,
Mmmh, jump in my car,
It's too far to walk on your own.
No, thank you, Sir -
Oh, come on now, I'm a trustworthy guy.
No, thank you, Sir -
Oh, little girl, I wouldn't tell you no lie.
I know your game -
How can you say that, we've only just met.
You're all the same -
Ooh, she's got me there, but I'll get her yet.
I got you then -
No, you didn't,
I was catching my breath.
Now look, it's starting to rain and baby,
You'll catch your death.
Well, I don't know -
Oh, come on now,
It costs nothin' to try.
And you'll arrive home nice and dry.
Mmh, jump in my car,
I wanna take you home.
Come on, jump in my car,
It's too far to walk on your own.
J-j-jump in my car,
I wanna take you home.
Come on, jump in my car,
It's too far to walk on your own.
Maybe I will -
Ah, that's better now.
You're talking sense.
You must keep still -
Well, if you like, I'll just put up the fence.
Please don't get smart -
Well, alright, we'll soon be on our way
We better start -
What for?
Because it's such a long way -
Why, where d'you live?
I live down south, it's roughly 84 miles -
Hey, slow down, you must be jokin',
Babe, behind that cute smile.
You know I'm not -
Well, if you're not,
There's only one thing to say.
And what's that? -
Get out the car, get on your way!
Get out o' my car.
But you just said that you'd take me home -
But it's too far.
But there's no way that I could make it alone -
I couldn't care less,
Maybe I could see you next week -
You sure look a mess.
Well, look who's talkin',
You got no right to speak -
Get out o' my car.
You told me that you were a really nice guy -
Well I ain't, well,
Get out o' my car - get out o' my car.
You heard what I said.
